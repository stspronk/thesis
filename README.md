ACADO TOOLKIT MATLAB INSTALL:


git clone https://github.com/acado/acado.git -b stable ACADOtoolkit

Navigate to the MATLAB installation directory by running:

cd *ACADO DIRECTORY*/interfaces/matlab/;
You are now ready to compile the ACADO interface. This compilation will take several minutes but needs to be done only once. Run “make” in your command window:

make clean all;

After the install is done ~3-5 minutes
savepath

If you dont save the path you will need to recompile a few files by running the make file in the interfaces folder again(5-10 seconds)
